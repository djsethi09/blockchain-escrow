# Real Estate Escrow DApp

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) for managing real estate transactions using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows buyers, sellers, inspectors, and lenders to interact securely and transparently through an escrow mechanism.

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language for Ethereum.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for Ethereum software.
- **OpenZeppelin**: Library for secure smart contract development.
- **Chai**: Assertion library for testing.
- **Ethers.js**: Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **JavaScript**: For writing tests and scripts.

## Components

### 1. Smart Contracts

- **Escrow.sol**: Manages the escrow process, including deposits, approvals, and finalizing sales.
- **RealEstate.sol**: Implements the ERC721 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing real estate properties.
- **Counter.sol**: A simple counter contract for demonstration purposes.

### 2. Testing

- **RealEstate.js**: Contains tests for the RealEstate contract, ensuring that the NFT ownership and transactions are handled correctly.
- **Counter.js**: Tests for the Counter contract, verifying its increment and decrement functionality.

### 3. Deployment

- **Lock.js**: A Hardhat Ignition module for managing contract deployments.
